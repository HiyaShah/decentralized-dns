# How Does a Blockchain work?

1. Each block consists of transactions
2. Transaction has valuable data we want to store
3. Mining: Put transactions together and show Proof Of Work
4. Add Blocks to the Chain
5. Est. decentralization and consensus

# DNS x Blockchain
DNS- Traditional Way
- centralized structure

DNS- Blockchain Way (my project)
- decentralized structure
- removes inconsistencies

# Project Steps
Store info & transactions in the Blocks
DNS entry and Database
Proof Of Work
Add Blocks to the Chain
Create the Interface
Est. decentralization and consensus
Build the application
Run it! Demo time.
