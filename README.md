# Decentralized DNS

Credits: Starting, base code cloned from https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app.

# How Does a Blockchain work?

1. Each block consists of transactions
2. Transaction has valuable data we want to store
3. Mining: Put transactions together and show Proof Of Work
4. Add Blocks to the Chain
5. Est. decentralization and consensus

# DNS x Blockchain
DNS- Traditional Way
- centralized structure

DNS- Blockchain Way (my project)
- decentralized structure
- removes inconsistencies

# Project Steps
1. Store info & transactions in the Blocks
2. DNS entry and Database
3. Proof Of Work
4. Add Blocks to the Chain
5. Create the Interface
6. Est. decentralization and consensus
7. Build the application
8. Run it! Demo time.
